# Projects are containers. Each has a due date, a priority, a contact list, a set of info links, and
# can contain other projects and lists of tasks.

# Tasks are chunks of work. They have an estimated number of time chunks to complete, and optionally a
# due date, priority, contact list, links, and lists of sub tasks.

# Chores are things that you get rewarded for doing on time. You can set them by time, and they'll get put
#  in the next administrative block until you check it off.

# Use case: Heavy email
# Things come up during the day. You should, for example, check your email in your five minute chunk cool
# down periods. Let's say you're looking at your mail and you see that you need to send a reply mail that's going
# to take time and effort to compose. This is a new task! You can easily start new tasks, and tasks needn't be
# associated with a particular project. When you create a new task, you can specify that you need to work on it
# in your next chunk, or add it to your current day with a simple command.

# Follow-ups are items that come up during a chunk. You can quickly add a follow-up, with a priority, and it will be
# added to the appropriate cool-down period automatically. It's easy to expand a follow-up to a stand-alone task or
# to a project. But you don't have to distract yourself with that level of scrutiny when you enter them.

# Some open issues:
# * How to differentiate between work-day and home tasks?
