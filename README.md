# scatterbrain #
An application to give direction to scattered brains.

## Overview ##
This is an application that I'm developing to cope with my own ADD so that I can get things done and spend less time spinning my wheels.

Maybe what works for me will work for you too. That would be really cool! Let's talk a little bit about the problems I'm trying to solve, so you can tell whether you might like scatterbrain.

I designed scatterbrain to deal with X main problems associated with my ADD that keep me from getting things done:

1.  Too many possibilities
2.  Not enough clarity
3.  Fear of drudgery

### Too many possibilities ###
My ADD causes me to be unproductive sometimes, which makes people think that I'm not engaged with anything. But the reality is that I am engaged with too many possibilities. When confronted with a problem, I have no difficulty imagining solutions. But I can imagine too many solutions, and along the way, I imaging orthogonal and parallel solutions: sidetracks and tangents. Eventually, my brain is full of possibilities about what to do, but the work of sorting through them to figure out what to next can be too much for me to handle. I might spend a bunch of time writing partial documents about a series of things that may or may not be related to the problem at hand, working on things that excite me, and then getting side-tracked, distracted and lost in the maze of possibilities.
