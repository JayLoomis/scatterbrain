# scatterbrain #
An application to give direction to scattered brains.

## Overview ##
This is an application that I'm developing to cope with my own ADD so that I 
can get things done and spend less time spinning my wheels.

Maybe what works for me will work for you too. That would be really cool! 
Let's talk a little bit about the problems I'm trying to solve, so you can 
tell whether you might like scatterbrain.

### The problem space ###
I designed scatterbrain to deal with 3 main problems associated with my ADD 
that keep me from getting things done:

1.  Too many possibilities
2.  Not enough clarity
3.  Abandonment syndrome
4.  Fear of drudgery

#### Too many possibilities ####
My ADD causes me to be unproductive sometimes, which makes people think that 
I'm not engaged with anything. But the reality is that I am engaged with too 
many possibilities. When confronted with a problem, I have no difficulty 
imagining solutions. But I can imagine too many solutions, and along the way, 
I imaging orthogonal and parallel solutions: sidetracks and tangents. 
Eventually, my brain is full of possibilities about what to do, but the work 
of sorting through them to figure out what to next can be too much for me to 
handle. I might spend a bunch of time writing partial documents about a series 
of things that may or may not be related to the problem at hand, working on 
things that excite me, and then getting side-tracked, distracted and lost in 
the maze of possibilities. 

#### Not enough clarity ####
Left to my own devices, my brain isn't good at coping with what to do next. This isn't about being unable to break down projects into tasks, as is often said of ADD sufferers, but rather it's a case of deciding which task to do next and committing to it. When tasks are ambiguous, or defined in my brain with less detail than needed, they become opaque an my brain ignores them. Sometimes all that I need is to switch the order of a couple of tasks and the way can be cleared, but other times I might need to focus on clarifying the way forward.

#### Abandonment syndrome ####
When I start working on a new project, I often get a burst of adrenaline that carries me into the initial work. That wears off quickly, and I move from excitement to be working on something new to sedated. Sometimes I can talk to a stakeholder to get that juice going again, but if I'm not careful, I can drop a project into the black hole of, "I'll get back to that eventually." Meanwhile, new, shiny things are pumping their own adrenaline into my brain, and keeping the gloss on what I was already working on is almost impossible.

#### Fear of drudgery ####
The easiest things to put off are those tasks that are boring or rote. Even though these things are often the easiest tasks to get done in a hurry. My ADD brain is always on the lookout for the next stimulating thing, and doesn't like focusing on things that are too easy. 

### The solution ###
The features of scatterbrain address my ADD problems directly:

#### Time chunking ####
Tasks are chunked using a simplified version of the Pomodoro method: we split the day into 30-minute chunks, of which 25 minutes are work and five are reflection, adjustment, administration, and preparation.

Some tasks may require more than one chunk of time to complete, but work is scheduled on a half-hour chunk.

#### Project definition ####
You can fully define projects within scatterbrain. This includes an expanding tree of task breakdowns, contacts, due dates, and everything else you need to get the work done. You can do all of your work on a task using scatterbrain as a hub, so that you don't need to be distracted by your communication apps, calendars, and such. You define the order that tasks need to be done in scatterbrain, so it knows what to serve you up next.

#### Daily work scheduling ####
You don't plan out your day in advance with scatterbrain. Sure, you can block off time for meetings and appointments, but your work is scheduled one chunk at a time. This is because planning out a whole day of work makes my ADD brain really uncomfortable. When it's time for a chunk of work, scatterbrain will tell you which task to work on next. Of course, you have input. You can tell scatterbrain how much time you need to devote to which tasks each day, or you can tell it the relative priority breakdown of various tasks and it will make that happen.

#### Gamify! ####
After each chunk, scatterbrain will ask you how it went. Did you spend a solid 25 minutes working on the assigned task? How would you rate your focus during that chunk? The answers will give you stars (or coins?). You can set goals and earn achievements.
